**Maze Solver (Enhanced Fork)**
This project is a fork of the original Maze Solver by angeluriot, licensed under the MIT License. 
<br />The original project provided a foundational algorithm to solve mazes, which I have extended with additional features to support my Final Year Project (FYP) objectives.

**Enhancements in This Fork:**
<br />Maze Grid Adjustment: Added flexibility to adjust the dimensions and structure of the maze grid.
<br />Finish Time Tracking: Implemented a feature to record the time taken to reach the maze's end.
<br />Memory Consumption Monitoring: Added functionality to measure and display the memory consumed during maze-solving.
